# The Enemy — summary 

#### * What have we learned ? 
  
## A man was washed to shore 
The story begins with a simple description of Sadao's house, and what he did there as a child. What is important to remember is that there are islands not very far from the house, and the house itself is in the shore. Also, we learn about Sadao's father a bit — we learn that all he cared about was his son's education which is why at the age of 22 Sadao was sent to America to study medicine. There he met his wife Hana, but waited before he fell in love because he had to make sure she was really Japanese. After he came back to Japan Sadao became not Only a famous doctor but also a famous scientist. He was working on an invention (something that will make wounds very clean very fast), and that is the official reason to why he was not drafted to the army in the war. The real reason for that however, is that he was the doctor of the old General and had to stay close to him to give him the best care and quickly. Sadao is standing on their porch with Hana and they look at the sea that is covered with fog, which means a mystery is about to happen, when suddenly a black figure comes out of the sea. They see that the figure is of a man and they run to him. At first, they think that man is sailor washed from his boat and hit some rocks, but as they come closer, they see blood dripping from his wounds. She bends down to help him and sees the man's face —he is a white man, an American. They could see that he was young and was probably tortured before he got to the sea. After thinking about this for a while and not knowing what to do, Sadao remembered that the man is wounded and find a bullet wound that wasn’t treated, and opened. His first thought Was to put the man back to the sea and let him die, but then he noticed his cap and see that he is a sailor in the U.S Navy, meaning he is a prisoner of war. They realize that they can’t throw him back to sea (if he was not wounded, they would have turned him over to the police), so they decide to take him back to their house, treat 
him, make sure he heals and then turn him in to the police.

## The surgery 

```
They carry the man to their house and put him in Sadao's father old room where everything is Japanese. Since the man is so dirty, he needs to be washed before anything can be done to treat his wounds, but Hana does not want to touch him because he is her enemy, so they decide to tell Yumi, one of the servants and the one who takes care of the children, to wash the man, but Yumi refuses to wash him and help him after she realizes the man is American, and Hana doesn’t force her because she is afraid, she'll go to the police. Hana is left alone with the man and starts to clean him herself. When she is finished, Sadao comes in with this surgery kit and she understands that he's going to operate him. During the surgery Hana feels really bad and almost fainted. She comes to give him anesthetics and notices some scares on his neck and suspects that in fact he was tortured. She heard the rumors about torture and remembered how the General treats him wife at home, beats her, and thinks that maybe there is some truth to the rumors. 
Sadao starts talking to the white man, just like he talks to any of his patients, which tells us he forgot that the man on his table is his enemy. Sadao finds the bullet and takes it out and the surgery is finished. The man had a pulse, weak but still there, and Sadao gave him medicine and said that he will live after all that he has been through.  
```

## The man wakes up and the servants leave

```
The surgery was a success, the man survived, and then he wakes up. When he first woke up, Hana was in the room with him, and when he opened his eyes and realized where he was, his eyes filled with terror. Hana wanted to apologize for scaring him so she came closer to him and told him in English that he should not be afraid and fed him. Then Sadao comes in and see the man sitting in his bed, and the man, that looks not more than 20, asks him if he is going to turn him to the police, a question to which Sadao doesn’t know how to answer since he doesn’t know himself what to do with him. Sadao tells him to not tell him anything about himself, not even his name, unless he asks him. 
Outside the room Hana meets Sadao and tells him that the servants have threatened 
to leave. They told her that she and Sadao think more like Americans than like Japanese, 
and that they no longer think of their country first like they should. 

We learn then what the servants said: 
- The gardener — he thinks that the man was so close to death, so Sadao should have left him to die. 
- The cook — she thinks that Sadao just wanted to show off his skill of saving lives, that he is willing to save any life. 
- Yumi — she is the one taking care of the children, so she thinks of them — 
         if Sadao and Hana are caught, they will be judged as traitors, and will probably be executed (מוציאים להורג) 
         She wonders what will be with the children.

They say this loudly so that Hana could hear, and maybe change what they are doing. Even with all their threats, Hana still understands the prisoner and feels sorry for him. Then the white man says his name to her — his name is Tom. Sadao kept checking the stitches every day, and the last of them was out now. Since he saw the man was almost well, he went to his office and started writing a letter to the chief of police explaining exactly what happened with Tom. He wrote only the beginning, and 
then folded it and put it in his drawer. A week later, 2 things happened on the same day- 
a. The servants left- they just took all of their belongings and didn’t do their work, so Hana knew they were leaving that day. She was very a but since she fe the boss, she couldn’t show it. All of the servants were crying, and Yumi, told Hana that if she has any problems with the kids, she should call for her, Hana Just smiled and said thanks, but knew she wouldn’t call. 
All day long Hana and Sadao did the housework themselves, and Hana wondered why can't they see what they should do with the American — what any good Japanese would have done... 
Sadao went to Tom, and told him that he can get up for 5 minutes, and 5 more the 
next day to build up his strength. The man wanted to thank Sadao for saving his life, 
but Sadao said "don’t thank me too early" which made the man a bit afraid.

b. A messenger came- while Hana was working in the house (and doing the work the servants usually do), she saw a man in uniform come to the house. 
She was sure that the man came to arrest Sadao for having the American in their house, so she ran quickly to him, but the man in uniform ran straight after her. When they meet Sadao, he is in the garden, he sees the man in uniform and asks what he came for. The man says he is a messenger and that Sadao has to come to the palace quickly because the old General is in pain again. Hana is relieved, and when Sadao leaves, and comes to say goodbye to her, he notices how anxiety exhausted she 
seems, and realizes that he has to get rid of the American. 
```

## The General, the assassins and the prisoner's escape 
```
Sadao goes to the General, and probably tells him the full story of what happened with Tom. The General actually understand what Sadao is going through, because he too once studied in America (Princeton university). Sadao tries to explain that he doesn’t care for the man at all, and the General says that the fact that Sadao helped that man, and saved his life, only makes him more valuable to the General, since it just means that Sadao can save anyone. 
Sadao is the only doctor that the General trusts, so that makes him very important. It also means that the General can’t have him arrested, so he could always treat him. As they kept talking, the General offered to send his assassins to murder the American, at some day of the week at night. Sadao agrees, because he aie knows that he has to get rid of Tom. he decides not to tell Hana of the plan and keeps acting normal. On his way home, he thinks that Tom will be in bed when he arrives, but he is surprised to see that he is standing. They talk a bit and then go to sleep. 
For 2 nights Sadao sleeps really bad, because he is worried that any little sound means the assassins, but in the mornings, Tom is still alive. The third night there is a very loud crash and both Hana and Sadao wake up. Hana wants to get up and check if everything Is ok, but Sadao begs her not to (he thinks the sound was the assassins). In the morning Tom is still alive, and Sadao realizes he must get away from the 
house.

Sadao prepares one of his small boats, puts food and bottled water in it, and explains Tom that he must sail to a nearby deserted island, and hide there until he sees a Korean fishing boat, that could save him. after thinking for a while, Sadao decides to give Tom his flashlight, so he could signal them — twice if the food runs out before a boat comes, and once if he is still there but all is good. Sadao also says to signal only at sunset, so that nobody but Sadao won't notice. Tom leaves at night, after he shook Sadao's hand warmly, and signals that he found an island. That night, Sadao 
who had nothing more to worry about, slept well. 
```


## The END!!!! 
```
The General had to go through a surgery, so Sadao couldn’t talk to him about the "escape ' of the prisoner and the assassins that were supposed to come. Until he could, the servants already returned to the house. Yumi cleaned the room where Tom was really good, and she even burned sulfur in there to make the smell of a white man disappear. 
When Sadao could talk to the General about Tom, he told him that he escaped. The General, asks if was supposed to send assassins, and said that because he was in such pains, he simply couldn’t think of anyone else but himself, so he forgot. Sadao realizes that the General is in the palm of his hand. The General says that Sadao is a good man who should be rewarded, and at the same time Sadao watches through the window, and sees no flashes, meaning Tom is no longer on the siandeand he felt so rewarded. 
The final scene is when Sadao looks of his veranda (the porch), and thinks, without reason, of all the Americans he knows. When he was a student in America, the people there treated him very badly only because he was japanese, and decided that 
all Americans are repulsive- he really hated them. But then he remembered Tom's face, and he wonder why didn’t he kill him?
